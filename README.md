# To Run:
1) Clone repo.
2) Run `yarn` to install dependencies. 
3) Navigate to /simple-server and start the server with `node server`.
4) Navigate back to root and run `yarn start` to run the React App.

## Notes
1) No responsive design or media queries present for smaller devices, as it wasn't included in the spec.
